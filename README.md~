# Popular Movies Application

Here is a functional and amazing android app which I made from scratch for Android Mobile App Launchpad a program supported by MCIT and Google.

## Features

With this app, you can do the follwing:
* Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies.
* Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline.
* Watch trailers via youtube or browser
* Read reviews of movie

## How deal with project code

Popular Movie App use [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies.
so you want to get your API Key, and just paste it to:
    ```
    app/build.gradle
    ```
